#####ARL Based Recommender System using the Armut Data
 
#####Business Problem : 
Armut, Turkey's largest online service platform, brings together service providers and those who want to receive service. It provides easy access to services such as cleaning, modification and transportation with a few touches on the computer or smart phone. It is desired to create a product recommendation system with Association Rule Learning by using the data set containing the service users and the services and categories these users have received.
